# Privacy Policy for Open in Stremio

**Effective Date: January 5, 2026**

## Introduction

"Open in Stremio" is a browser extension that adds Stremio buttons to Google and DuckDuckGo search results for movies and TV shows. This privacy policy explains how the extension handles user data.

## Data Collection

**This extension does not collect any data.**

We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information or browsing data. The extension operates entirely locally within your browser.

## What the Extension Does

The extension performs the following actions, all of which occur locally on your device:

1. **Reads search result pages** — When you search for a movie or TV show on Google or DuckDuckGo, the extension scans the page to detect streaming service panels.

2. **Extracts IMDb IDs** — The extension reads IMDb links already present on the search results page to identify the correct movie or TV show.

3. **Injects a button** — A "Stremio" button is added to the streaming options panel, allowing you to open the content in the Stremio desktop app.

No information from these actions is stored, logged, or transmitted anywhere.

## Permissions

This extension requires access to the following websites:

- **Google Search domains** (google.com, google.co.uk, google.ca, etc.) — To add the Stremio button to movie/TV search results
- **DuckDuckGo** (duckduckgo.com) — To add the Stremio button to movie/TV search results

These permissions are used solely to modify the appearance of search result pages by adding a Stremio button. The extension cannot access any other websites, tabs, or browser data.

## Third-Party Services

This extension does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

When you click the Stremio button, you are redirected to the Stremio application on your device. The Stremio app has its own privacy policy, which you can review at [stremio.com](https://www.stremio.com/).
